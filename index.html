							<h2>Hi, you probably found this from my SL profile.<br />
							I've been playing SL since 2012 but I've been banned several times and please don't ask why.</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Friends come and go, nothing is permanent in this world even in virtual life. I consider secondlife as my personal development environment. It is a term mostly used in software industries, think of it as a sandbox where I can do whatever I want without destroying the entire system if I made an epic mistake. The reason I came back is to tests and see myself with a companion who understands my dynamics. I found myself more productive by collaborating and taking the lead, but my social anxiety hinders me from working with others.

If you'd like to engage in this kind of Role-play where I will take the dominant figure who will be in charge of most of the decisions and technical aspect of the game (e.i. Scripting, RLV, etc). While you keep me encouraged, entertained and involved in the activities that you will lay out for me daily (if possible).

The challenge is to survive the toxic players of second life, obtain lindens without spending real life money and keep the companionship as long as possible.</p>

						<h2>Requirements:</h2>
						<div class="row">
						<ul>
						<li>Must be female in RL. <i>"please don't make it awkward for me I don't care what kind of sexual orientation you are ingame but please be female in real life."</i>
						<li>Knows how to navigate, fix and adjust their outfits or atleast familar with the basic interface of secondlife viewer (preferably Firestorm).
						<li>Voice chat! communication is needed especially when we are engaged in a project. I don't require you to be on voice daily or if it's not convenient for you in real life but please get yourself a decent headphone. English is not my native tongue so there will be times I will misunderstand your tone from your typed text.
						<li>I have a very low libido because of the cocktail of psych meds im taking so don't expect a very sexual dynamics. Although I will let you roam free if your service is not required.
						<li>Willing to be monitored everytime you're online with your avatar. I will be giving you a modified collar that sends information to my phone of your whereabouts, nearby people and neaby chats.
						<li>Creative, Energetic and willing to share ideas. I love lsl scripting but I fail on building and all the aesthetic aspects. This is where you fill the void.
						<li>Willing to learn. I believe we will be spending a lot of time exploring and tinkering stuff.
						<li>Your goal is to please me. I easily get bored so you need to be spontaneous.

						<li>
My main avatar was BryanKent. I used to make custom auction system for breedable specially Feenux. 
I am the one that revolutionized the breedable auctions by removing the use of notecards and make the system intuitive and easy to use for the patrons.
It was a good business until my partner left me and couldn't handle all the customer support and inquiries. 
I left the game and come back within a year then made a network of automated fishbot milking goldtokens.net for lindens. 
I used to engage in kidnap/bondage RP by using my RLV script. 
My hobby is to abduct someone and transform them to my liking then release them with a modified collar where I can listen and sometimes control their conversation. 
There are times I forced them into prostitution and taught them how to earn lindens until it becomes their trade skill. 
I experience what it's like to run a harem and deal with everyone's temperament. It was a soul draining experience. 
Now I'm back again with a new adventure in mind. 
I'm planning to put up a blog once I found the right person to be my partner in crime.
